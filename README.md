# Public_and_Private_Housing_Environments-
This project explores spatial differences between public and private housing in Copenhagen using open geospatial data from the City of Copenhagen. The analysis focuses on access to public services, exposure to environmental risks (e.g., noise and flooding), and proximity to recreational and cultural facilities.
